Get Are Way,"1 ContributorGet Are Way LyricsReal niggas are still alive they just hide in the crowd when young niggas cup their bags they'll be cheering and proud We ate from the same bowl we were raised like we cubs, most of my OGs dark side they don’t fuck with the cups Broke niggas get they bags when they snitch on thugs, Men had to take a break from fake peers and fake hugs If you ain't drinking profit you at the counter you and your niggas over prices checking your pocket Phoney niggas playing dead like thеre is mo service, lеt your homies take losses with no ceilings Why these niggas showing hands if they not helping, they want a piece of every slice when you gone fishing Cheers to the bench squad I'll be still running ,niggas waited on my fall ended on my wave taking shorts on the low cause they still trying When the karma hits you back niggas practice what you preach  _____________ [I’ve been tryna get away From all these niggas who be hating on a low key yeah !
