Gang members from Bellingham would later join Catford, Anti/ Anti-Shower, in opposition to the Ghetto Boys offshoot set, Shower.

They are 1/3 of the 51st gang alliance, the “1” being reference to their NW1 postcode, with Peckwater and Queens Crescent being NW5.

The current generation are predominantly of Congolese origin.
Around 2007/08 their close association with QC Blox saw the Cumbo Boys begin to refer to their gang as the Cumbo Blox and adopt the red gang colours and begin to claim Blood affiliation

HRB,"HRB (Harrow Road Boys) (🩸) are a gang based around Harrow Road on the Mozart estate, however they also claim Queens Park, Avenue Gardens and Lydford estates and Ashmore Road, within the W9/W10 postcodes.
They are also known as Mozart, Zart, Mexico, Mozart Bloods, and PG (Park Gardens) and have historically flagged the colour red, in reference to the red bricks that used to make up the estate, and the fact that they shared a close alliance with the 031 Blood set from Brixton, CFR. They were also part of the SMG Blood alliance along with (S) St. Raphs, (M) Mozart, (G) Kensal Green.
Before the Mozart Bloods, the area boasted several smaller gangs based along Harrow Road known as the “Horror Road Alliance”. Sets included the Grimiest Movement, Street Dreams, who wore brown, Grey Dayz who wore grey and C.R.I.M.E (Can’t Roll In My Ends) who wore blue.

Mali Strip,"Mali Boys, also known as Mali Strip, are a gang from the areas of Leyton (E10) and Walthamstow (E17) of Waltham Forest. They are divided into two sets, with LTizzy representing E10 and SJ representing E17.
The Mali Boys roots lay with the older and once dominant Beaumont Boys gang located on the Beaumont Estate in Leyton, E10. Somali members who would gain access to the drugs market from the more experienced Jamaican olders would eventually organise the Somali youth under their wing and break off to form their own organisation, becoming rivals.
Unlike other gangs who beef over postcodes or personal issues, Mali Boys beef is often based upon their imposing onto the drug turf of other gangs.
While the Mali Boys maintain a very low profile on social media, they have been known to use it to gather information on rivals and police for the purpose of intimidation and fear. They have been known to spy and maintain very detailed records on police stations, undercover police officers and cars. In some instances, they have been known to force local business owners to destroy CCTV footage that could be used by authorities to link members to crimes.
